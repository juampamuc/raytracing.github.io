                             **Chapter 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchies**

This part is by far the most difficult and involved part of the ray tracer we are working on. I am
sticking it in Chapter 2 so the code can run faster, and because it refactors `hitable` a little,
and when I add rectangles and boxes we won't have to go back and refactor them.

The ray-object intersection is the main time-bottleneck in a ray tracer, and the time is linear with
the number of objects. But it’s a repeated search on the same model, so we ought to be able to make
it a logarithmic search in the spirit of binary search. Because we are sending millions to billions
of rays on the same model, we can do an analog of sorting the model and then each ray intersection
can be a sublinear search. The two most common families of sorting are to 1) divide the space, and
2) divide the objects. The latter is usually much easier to code up and just as fast to run for most
models.

The key idea of a bounding volume over a set of primitives is to find a volume that fully encloses
(bounds) all the objects. For example, suppose you computed a bounding sphere of 10 objects. Any ray
that misses the bounding sphere definitely misses all ten objects. If the ray hits the bounding
sphere, then it might hit one of the ten objects. So the bounding code is always of the form:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    if (ray hits bounding object)
        return whether ray hits bounded objects
    else
        return false
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A key thing is we are dividing objects into subsets. We are not dividing the screen or the volume.
Any object is in just one bounding volume, but bounding volumes can overlap.

To make things sub-linear we need to make the bounding volumes hierarchical. For example, if we
divided a set of objects into two groups, red and blue, and used rectangular bounding volumes, we’d
have:

![Figure 2-1](../assets/fig2-01.jpg)

Note that the blue and red bounding volumes are contained in the purple one, but they might
overlap, and they are not ordered -- they are just both inside. So the tree shown on the right has
no concept of ordering in the left and right children; they are simply inside. The code would be:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    if (hits purple)
        hit0 = hits blue enclosed objects
        hit1 = hits red enclosed objects
        if (hit0 or hit1)
            return true and info of closer hit
    return false
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get that all to work we need a way to make good divisions, rather than bad ones, and a way to
intersect a ray with a bounding volume. A ray bounding volume intersection needs to be fast, and
bounding volumes need to be pretty compact. In practice for most models, axis-aligned boxes work
better than the alternatives, but this design choice is always something to keep in mind if you
encounter unusual types of models.

From now on we will call axis-aligned bounding rectangular parallelepiped (really, that is what they
need to be called if precise) axis-aligned bounding boxes, or AABBs. Any method you want to use to
intersect a ray with an AABB is fine. And all we need to know is whether or not we hit it; we don’t
need hit points or normals or any of that stuff that we need for an object we want to display.

Most people use the “slab” method. This is based on the observation that an n-dimensional AABB is
just the intersection of n axis-aligned intervals, often called “slabs” An interval is just
the points between two endpoints, _e.g._, $x$ such that $3 < x < 5$, or more succinctly $x$ in
$(3,5)$. In 2D, two intervals overlapping makes a 2D AABB (a rectangle):

![Figure 2-2](../assets/fig2-02.jpg)

For a ray to hit one interval we first need to figure out whether the ray hits the boundaries. For
example, again in 2D, this is the ray parameters $t_0$ and $t_1$. (If the ray is parallel to the
plane those will be undefined.)

![Figure 2-3](../assets/fig2-03.jpg)

In 3D, those boundaries are planes. The equations for the planes are $x = x_0$, and $x = x_1$. Where
does the ray hit that plane? Recall that the ray can be thought of as just a function that given a
$t$ returns a location $p(t)$:

    $$ p(t) = A + t \cdot B $$

That equation applies to all three of the x/y/z coordinates. For example $x(t) = A_x + t \cdot B_x$.
This ray hits the plane $x = x_0$ at the $t$ that satisfies this equation:

    $$ x_0 = A_x + t_0 \cdot B_x $$

Thus $t$ at that hitpoint is:

    $$ t_0 = \frac{x_0 - A_x}{B_x} $$

We get the similar expression for $x_1$:

    $$ t_1 = \frac{x_1 - A_x}{B_x} $$

The key observation to turn that 1D math into a hit test is that for a hit, the $t$-intervals need
to overlap. For example, in 2D the green and blue overlapping only happens if there is a hit:

![Figure 2-4](../assets/fig2-04.jpg)

What “do the t intervals in the slabs overlap?” would like in code is something like:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    compute (tx0, tx1)
    compute (ty0, ty1)
    return overlap?( (tx0, tx1), (ty0, ty1))
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is awesomely simple, and the fact that the 3D version also works is why people love the
slab method:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    compute (tx0, tx1)
    compute (ty0, ty1)
    compute (tz0, tz1)
    return overlap?( (tx0, tx1), (ty0, ty1), (tz0, tz1))
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some caveats that make this less pretty than it first appears. First, suppose the ray is
travelling in the negative $x$ direction. The interval $(t_{x0}, t_{x1})$ as computed above might be
reversed, _e.g._ something like $(7, 3)$. Second, the divide in there could give us infinities. And
if the ray origin is on one of the slab boundaries, we can get a `NaN`. There are many ways these
issues are dealt with in various ray tracers’ AABB. (There are also vectorization issues like SIMD
which we will not discuss here. Ingo Wald’s papers are a great place to start if you want to go the
extra mile in vectorization for speed.) For our purposes, this is unlikely to be a major bottleneck
as long as we make it reasonably fast, so let’s go for simplest, which is often fastest anyway!
First let’s look at computing the intervals:

    $$ t_{x0} = \frac{x_0 - A_x}{B_x} $$
    $$ t_{x1} = \frac{x_1 - A_x}{B_x} $$

One troublesome thing is that perfectly valid rays will have $B_x = 0$, causing division by zero.
Some of those rays are inside the slab, and some are not. Also, the zero will have a ± sign under
IEEE floating point. The good news for $B_x = 0$ is that $t_{x0}$ and $t_{x1}$ will both be +∞ or
both be -∞ if not between $x_0$ and $x_1$. So, using min and max should get us the right answers:

    $$ t_{x0} = min(\frac{x_0 - A_x}{B_x}, \frac{x_1 - A_x}{B_x}) $$
    $$ t_{x1} = max(\frac{x_0 - A_x}{B_x}, \frac{x_1 - A_x}{B_x}) $$

The remaining troublesome case if we do that is if $B_x = 0$ and either $x_0 - A_x = 0$ or $x_1-A_x
= 0$ so we get a `NaN`. In that case we can probably accept either hit or no hit answer, but we’ll
revisit that later.

Now, let’s look at that overlap function. Suppose we can assume the intervals are not reversed (so
the first value is less than the second value in the interval) and we want to return true in that
case. The boolean overlap that also computes the overlap interval $(f, F)$ of intervals $(d, D)$ and
$(e, E)$ would be:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    bool overlap(d, D, e, E, f, F)
        f = max(d, e)
        F = min(D, E)
        return (f < F)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are any `NaN`s running around there, the compare will return false so we need to be sure
our bounding boxes have a little padding if we care about grazing cases (and we probably should
because in a ray tracer all cases come up eventually). With all three dimensions in a loop and
passing in the interval $t_{min}$, $t_{max}$ we get:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    inline float ffmin(float a, float b) { return a < b ? a : b; }
    inline float ffmax(float a, float b) { return a > b ? a : b; }

    class aabb {
        public:
            aabb() {}
            aabb(const vec3& a, const vec3& b) { _min = a; _max = b;}

            vec3 min() const {return _min; }
            vec3 max() const {return _max; }

            bool hit(const ray& r, float tmin, float tmax) const {
                for (int a = 0; a < 3; a++) {
                    float t0 = ffmin((_min[a] - r.origin()[a]) / r.direction()[a],
                                     (_max[a] - r.origin()[a]) / r.direction()[a]);
                    float t1 = ffmax((_min[a] - r.origin()[a]) / r.direction()[a],
                                     (_max[a] - r.origin()[a]) / r.direction()[a]);
                    tmin = ffmax(t0, tmin);
                    tmax = ffmin(t1, tmax);
                    if (tmax <= tmin)
                        return false;
                }
                return true;
            }

            vec3 _min;
            vec3 _max;
    };
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the built-in `fmax()` is replaced by `ffmax()` which is quite a bit faster because it
doesn’t worry about `NaN`s and other exceptions. In reviewing this intersection method, Andrew
Kensler at Pixar tried some experiments and has proposed this version of the code which works
extremely well on many compilers, and I have adopted it as my go-to method:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    inline bool aabb::hit(const ray& r, float tmin, float tmax) const {
        for (int a = 0; a < 3; a++) {
            float invD = 1.0f / r.direction()[a];
            float t0 = (min()[a] - r.origin()[a]) * invD;
            float t1 = (max()[a] - r.origin()[a]) * invD;
            if (invD < 0.0f)
                std::swap(t0, t1);
            tmin = t0 > tmin ? t0 : tmin;
            tmax = t1 < tmax ? t1 : tmax;
            if (tmax <= tmin)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now need to add a function to compute bounding boxes to all of the hitables. Then we will make a
hierarchy of boxes over all the primitives and the individual primitives, like spheres, will live at
the leaves. That function returns a bool because not all primitives have bounding boxes (_e.g._,
infinite planes). In addition, objects move so it takes `time1` and `time2` for the interval of the
frame and the bounding box will bound the object moving through that interval.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    class hitable  {
        public:
            virtual bool hit(
                const ray& r, float t_min, float t_max, hit_record& rec) const = 0;
            virtual bool bounding_box(float t0, float t1, aabb& box) const = 0;
    };
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a sphere, that `bounding_box` function is easy:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    bool sphere::bounding_box(float t0, float t1, aabb& box) const {
        box = aabb(center - vec3(radius, radius, radius),
                   center + vec3(radius, radius, radius));
        return true;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For `moving sphere`, we can take the box of the sphere at $t_0$, and the box of the sphere at $t_1$,
and compute the box of those two boxes:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    bool moving_sphere::bounding_box(float t0, float t1, aabb& box) const {
        aabb box0(center(t0) - vec3(radius, radius, radius),
                  center(t0) + vec3(radius, radius, radius));
        aabb box1(center(t1) - vec3(radius, radius, radius),
                  center(t1) + vec3(radius, radius, radius));
        box = surrounding_box(box0, box1);
        return true;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For lists you can store the bounding box at construction, or compute it on the fly. I like doing it
the fly because it is only usually called at BVH construction.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    bool hitable_list::bounding_box(float t0, float t1, aabb& box) const {
        if (list_size < 1) return false;
        aabb temp_box;
        bool first_true = list[0]->bounding_box(t0, t1, temp_box);
        if (!first_true)
            return false;
        else
            box = temp_box;
        for (int i = 1; i < list_size; i++) {
            if(list[i]->bounding_box(t0, t1, temp_box)) {
                box = surrounding_box(box, temp_box);
            }
            else
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This requires the `surrounding_box` function for `aabb` which computes the bounding box of two
boxes:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    aabb surrounding_box(aabb box0, aabb box1) {
        vec3 small( ffmin(box0.min().x(), box1.min().x()),
                    ffmin(box0.min().y(), box1.min().y()),
                    ffmin(box0.min().z(), box1.min().z()));
        vec3 big  ( ffmax(box0.max().x(), box1.max().x()),
                    ffmax(box0.max().y(), box1.max().y()),
                    ffmax(box0.max().z(), box1.max().z()));
        return aabb(small,big);
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A BVH is also going to be a `hitable` -- just like lists of `hitable`s. It’s really a container, but
it can respond to the query “does this ray hit you?”. One design question is whether we have two
classes, one for the tree, and one for the nodes in the tree; or do we have just one class and have
the root just be a node we point to. I am a fan of the one class design when feasible. Here is such
a class:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    class bvh_node : public hitable  {
        public:
            bvh_node() {}
            bvh_node(hitable **l, int n, float time0, float time1);
            virtual bool hit(const ray& r, float tmin, float tmax, hit_record& rec) const;
            virtual bool bounding_box(float t0, float t1, aabb& box) const;
            hitable *left;
            hitable *right;
            aabb box;
    };


    bool bvh_node::bounding_box(float t0, float t1, aabb& b) const {
        b = box;
        return true;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the children pointers are to generic hitables. They can be other `bvh_nodes`, or
`spheres`, or any other `hitable`.

The `hit` function is pretty straightforward: check whether the box for the node is hit, and if so,
check the children and sort out any details:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    bool bvh_node::hit(const ray& r, float t_min, float t_max, hit_record& rec) const {
        if (box.hit(r, t_min, t_max)) {
            hit_record left_rec, right_rec;
            bool hit_left = left->hit(r, t_min, t_max, left_rec);
            bool hit_right = right->hit(r, t_min, t_max, right_rec);
            if (hit_left && hit_right) {
                if (left_rec.t < right_rec.t)
                    rec = left_rec;
                else
                    rec = right_rec;
                return true;
            }
            else if (hit_left) {
                rec = left_rec;
                return true;
            }
            else if (hit_right) {
                rec = right_rec;
                return true;
            }
            else
                return false;
        }
        else return false;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most complicated part of any efficiency structure, including the BVH, is building it. We do this
in the constructor. A cool thing about BVHs is that as long as the list of objects in a `bvh_node`
gets divided into two sub-lists, the hit function will work. It will work best if the division is
done well, so that the two children have smaller bounding boxes than their parent’s bounding box,
but that is for speed not correctness. I’ll choose the middle ground, and at each node split the
list along one axis. I’ll go for simplicity:

1. randomly choose an axis
2. sort the primitives using library qsort
3. put half in each subtree

I used the old-school C `qsort` rather than the C++ sort because I need a different compare operator
depending on axis, and `qsort` takes a compare function rather than using the less-than operator. I
pass in a pointer to pointer -- this is just C for “array of pointers” because a pointer in C can
also just be a pointer to the first element of an array.

When the list coming in is two elements, I put one in each subtree and end the recursion. The
traverse algorithm should be smooth and not have to check for null pointers, so if I just have one
element I duplicate it in each subtree. Checking explicitly for three elements and just following
one recursion would probably help a little, but I figure the whole method will get optimized later.
This yields:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    bvh_node::bvh_node(hitable **l, int n, float time0, float time1) {
        int axis = int(3*random_double());
        if (axis == 0)
           qsort(l, n, sizeof(hitable *), box_x_compare);
        else if (axis == 1)
           qsort(l, n, sizeof(hitable *), box_y_compare);
        else
           qsort(l, n, sizeof(hitable *), box_z_compare);
        if (n == 1) {
            left = right = l[0];
        }
        else if (n == 2) {
            left = l[0];
            right = l[1];
        }
        else {
            left = new bvh_node(l, n/2, time0, time1);
            right = new bvh_node(l + n/2, n - n/2, time0, time1);
        }
        aabb box_left, box_right;
        if (!left->bounding_box(time0,time1, box_left) ||
            !right->bounding_box(time0,time1, box_right)
           ) {
            std::cerr << "no bounding box in bvh_node constructor\n";
        }
        box = surrounding_box(box_left, box_right);
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The check for whether there is a bounding box at all is in case you sent in something like an
infinite plane that doesn’t have a bounding box. We don’t have any of those primitives, so it
shouldn’t happen until you add such a thing.

The compare function has to take void pointers which you cast. This is old-school C and reminded me
why C++ was invented. I had to really mess with this to get all the pointer junk right. If you like
this part, you have a future as a systems person!

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    int box_x_compare (const void * a, const void * b) {
        aabb box_left, box_right;
        hitable *ah = *(hitable**)a;
        hitable *bh = *(hitable**)b;

        if (!ah->bounding_box(0,0, box_left) || !bh->bounding_box(0,0, box_right))
            std::cerr << "no bounding box in bvh_node constructor\n";

        if (box_left.min().x() - box_right.min().x() < 0.0)
            return -1;
        else
            return 1;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
